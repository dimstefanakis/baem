            <p>Hey, and welcome to my world!</p>
            <p>
              My work is all about bold visual identity and clean, meaningful
              design. I focus on five main tattoo styles: Cybersigilism, Anime,
              Neo-Tribal, Y2K, and Gothic. Each category reflects a part of my
              influences â€” from digital minimalism and sacred geometry to
              nostalgic 2000s aesthetics and anime culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              I design for people all around the world. I&apos;m inspired by
              architecture, subcultures, internet visuals, and the power of
              strong symbolism. Whether you&apos;re into structured linework or soft
              character art, my goal is to create pieces that are personal,
              well-designed, and lasting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks for being here â€” I hope you find something that speaks to
              you.
            </p>
            <p>xx Mona ð“†™</p>
