I like building complex forms using clean lines, mirroring the logic of machines while keeping a sense of ritual and meaning behind each shape. Many of my pieces feel like digital talismans — bold, minimal, and coded with emotion or intent."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "This style also connects deeply with architectural influences, especially gothic and brutalist structures. I often break down symmetry, use layering, and experiment with distortion to create a sense of tension and beauty — something that feels almost like a digital relic or sigil for the modern age."

        "text": "I often mix cybersigilism with my other main styles: Anime, Neo Tribal, Y2K, and Gothic. Combining these lets me create designs that are visually unique and more versatile. For example, I might bring in expressive shapes from anime, bold tribal lines, or metallic Y2K textures to contrast with the sharp structure of cybersigilism. This approach gives each tattoo a distinct look while still staying true to my style."
